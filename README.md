# Netflix-Clone

Built a full-featured movie-streaming interface using React.js, integrating TMDB API to fetch movie posters, metadata, and YouTube trailers.

Implemented log in/sign up functionality using Firebase, enabling secure access to the home page.

Implemented an in-app video player that allows users to watch trailers directly on the site.

## UX/UI
